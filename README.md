# Spark OSM tools

Collection of snippets for OSM data processing.

## Rationale

Opestreetmap is a literally planet scale database storing features found on a Earth surfaces. Commonly used OSM processing software
either uses single host processing or converts and stores OSM data to some database engine and uses it as a source of truth for distributed
processing. With Spark abilities to automatically distribute huge dataset over hundreds of nodes and process more data, that a
single node could fit, it sounds pretty logical to process OSM data in a distributed manner on Spark.
